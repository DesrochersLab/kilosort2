# Kilosort 2.0 working for Plexon 32-channel probes

Working on Linux Kubuntu machine with CUDA installed locally. If using windows, cuda files need to be recompiled. All paths need to be adjusted in the kilo folder. I run master_kilosort.m from the kilo folder. The main loop should be the same. All files in Kilosort2 should be identical to the cloned version from the main repository (with mexcuda files compiled).
